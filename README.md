# Disney-Data-Visualization-ALY6070
This repository showcases my final project for the ALY 6070 Visualization for Data Analytics course, where I explored and visualized Disney-related data. The project demonstrates effective data communication techniques and visualization tools, including R for data processing, Excel for data management, and Tableau for interactive visualization.
